        I'm a Front-end developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
        I love the challenge of staying on top of industry trends and technologies,
        always pushing myself to learn and grow and making the web a more enjoyable place for everyone.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I specialise in creating user interfaces that align with client specifications and needs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm enthusiastic about enhancing customer experiences through thoughtful design, 
        and I understand the importance of a well-crafted digital presence in attracting venture capital.
